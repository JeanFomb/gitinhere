	<title>Step 2: A New Branch</title>
</head>
<body>

<!-- Welcome! you are now in the branch labeled "step2!"
 notice the file name also changed to step.html

 Why? 

 Because we are now in a new branch of work in github. 

 Why would you want to create different branches in github?
 	1. test things out
 		Lets say you are working on a new feature in your app. You can create a separate branch for testing ideas without messing up your original code.  

3. Go ahead and make a change to the file and commit and push your work to github.
	push your code with the following set of commands 
		git status
		git add .
		git status
		git commit -m "I made a change"
		git status
		git push origin step2

2. visit your fork of this repository and make sure you can see your both the master branch and the step 2 on github. 

Spend 20min practicing the creation of repositories, switching branches, and getting and committing code.  

We are going to be using github a lot so its best to get use to it now. You dont need to know everything but you should know the basics. You will learn the rest as we go on.
